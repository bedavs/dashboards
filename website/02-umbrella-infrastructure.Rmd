## Analysis Docker Image {#analysisdocker}

### Images

Our analysis Docker images are based off the [rocker](https://rocker-project.org) images. More specifically, the [rocker/verse:3.5.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/verse/) image.

This Docker image is then expanded upon by a separate Dockerfile [raw996/dhadley](https://github.com/raubreywhite/docker/blob/master/dhadley/Dockerfile). This Docker image is automatically rebuilt by `Jenkins` on `linux` whenever the repository is updated. The resultant Docker image is pushed to [raw996/dhadley:3.5.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dhadley/). This image is a general-purpose analysis image, with no sensitive information in it.

This Docker image is then expanded upon by a separate Dockerfile [raw996/dashboards_r](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/Dockerfile). This Docker image is automatically rebuilt by `Jenkins` on `linux` whenever the repository is updated. The resultant Docker image is locally tagged as `raw996/dashboards_r:test` and then a number of integration tests are performed on it. If the integration tests are passed, then the Docker image is retagged and pushed to [raw996/dashboards_r:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_r/). This image is private as it contains passwords and email addresses.

### File Structure {#internalfilestructure}

Inside `raw996/dashboards_r` we have the following file structure:

```
/data_raw/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/data_clean/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/data_app/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/results/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/  <soft linked to /r>
  |-- <OTHER R PACKAGES INSTALLED HERE>/
  |-- fhi/
  |-- normomo/
  |-- noispiah/
  |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- sykdomspuls_log/
  |-- <OTHER R PACKAGES INSTALLED HERE>/
```

Note that we have a soft link between `/r` and `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/`.

### cron {#cron}

We use [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to schedule the analyses. The schedule is specified in [crontab](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/crontab).

The cronjobs are only activated when the environmental variable `ADD=cron` is defined. Cronjobs are then activated through [add_cron.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/add_cron.sh).

In principle, cronjobs should only be activated on `smhb`.

### autofs {#autofs}

We use [autofs](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs) to connect to the F network. The network locations, username, and password are specified in [auto.mounts](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/auto.mounts).

Autofs is only activated when the environmental variable `ADD_AUTOFS=yes` is defined. Autofs is then activated through [add_autofs.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/add_autofs.sh).

In principle, autofs should only be activated on `smhb`.

## Reverse Proxy Docker Image

We use nginx as a reverse proxy to make rstudio server available to the developers.

The relevant Dockerfile is [here](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_nginx/Dockerfile) and is pushed to [raw996/dashboards_nginx:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_nginx/) after integration testing is passed.

## Docker Compose {#dockercompose}

[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is used to integrate these Docker images into the local filesystem. We have multiple docker-compose files for different reasons:

- For [production](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-prod.yml) on `smhb`
- For [testing](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-test.yml) on `linux`
- For [development](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-dev.yml) on a dev computer

## Production Computer - smhb

### crontab

```
# m h  dom mon dow   command
5 1 * * * /home/raw996/git/dashboards_control/bin/prod_update.sh
@reboot /home/raw996/git/dashboards_control/bin/prod_update.sh
```

### File Structure

```
/home/raw996/git/dashboards_control/
```

### Explanation

`smhb` is designed to be extremely simple. It has two jobs:

1. Updating [raw996/dashboards_r:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_r/), [raw996/dashboards_shiny:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_shiny/), and [raw996/dashboards_nginx:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_nginx/)
2. Making sure that [docker-compose-prod.yml](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/docker-compose-prod.yml) is running

We purposefully minimize all integration with the base machine, because this enables us to be deploy-environment independent and to move our deployment anywhere with minimal hassle.

## Integration Testing Computer - linux {#integrationtesting}

### File Structure

```
/home/raw996/
  |-- docker-compose-jenkins/
    |-- docker-compose.yml
  |-- data/
    |-- data_app/
      |-- normomo/
      |-- sykdomspuls/
    |-- data_clean/
      |-- normomo/
      |-- sykdomspuls/
    |-- data_raw/
      |-- normomo/
        |-- FHIDOD2_20170425.txt
      |-- sykdomspuls/
        |-- partially_formatted_2017_08_01.txt
    |-- data_results/
      |-- normomo/
      |-- sykdomspuls/
  |-- jenkins/
```

### Explanation

`linux` has three jobs:

1. Building [raw996/dhadley](https://github.com/raubreywhite/docker/blob/master/dhadley/Dockerfile
2. Integration testing for the automated analyses
3. Pushing [raw996/dashboards_r:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_r/), [raw996/dashboards_shiny:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_shiny/), and [raw996/dashboards_nginx:production](https://hub.docker.com/r/raw996/dashboards_nginx/) to Docker hub after successful integration testing

Integration testing happens by Jenkins running:

- [test_noispiah.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/bin/test_noispiah.sh)
- [test_normomo.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/bin/test_normomo.sh)
- [test_sykdomspuls.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/bin/test_sykdomspuls.sh)
- [test_sykdomspulslog.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/bin/test_sykdomspulslog.sh)
- [test_sykdomspulspdf.sh](https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/bin/test_sykdomspulspdf.sh)

## Unit Testing - travis-ci {#travis}

[Travis-ci](http://travis-ci.org/folkehelseinstituttet) is used for  [unit testing of packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/check.html#travis). If the R package passes all tests, then we use [drat](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat) to deploy a built version of the package to Folkehelseinstituttet's R repository: https://folkehelseinstituttet.github.io/drat/.
