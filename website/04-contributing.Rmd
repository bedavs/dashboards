# Contributing/Quickstart

## Quickstart {#quickstart}

1. Create a project folder for your code (let us say `~/git/dashboards`). This folder will be accessible from inside your Docker container as `/dashboards/`
2. Create a project folder for your data (let us say `~/data/`).
3. Clone the following repos inside `~/git/dashboards`:
    - https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/ (private)
4. Fork the following repos, and then clone the forks to your computer inside `~/git/dashboards`:
    - https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards/
    - https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards_sykdomspuls/
    - https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards_normomo/
    - https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards_sykdomspulspdf/
    - https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards_noispiah/
    - https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards_sykdomspulslog/
5. For each repo, add the folkehelseinstitutet repository as your upstream:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
```

6. In your `~/.profile` add the following three lines:

```
export DASHBOARDS_DATA=~/data/
export DASHBOARDS_FOLDER=~/git/dashboards/
export PATH=$PATH:$DASHBOARDS_FOLDER/dashboards_control/bin/
```

7. Build your Dockerfiles:

```
docker_build.sh
```

8. A number of folders will have been automatically created (see below). Please put in your development datafiles into the appropriate `data_raw/` folder:

```
- $DASHBOARDS_DATA/
  |-- data_app/
    |-- sykdomspuls/
    |-- normomo/
    |-- sykdomspuls_log/
    |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- data_clean/
    |-- sykdomspuls/
    |-- normomo/
    |-- sykdomspuls_log/
    |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- data_raw/
    |-- sykdomspuls/
    |-- normomo/
    |-- sykdomspuls_log/
    |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
  |-- results/
    |-- sykdomspuls/
    |-- normomo/
    |-- sykdomspuls_log/
    |-- sykdomspuls_pdf/
```

9 Run your docker-compose:

```
dev_up.sh
```

10. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8788/
11. Login using `username=rstudio` and `password=rstudio1`
12. Using the project menu, open the project corresponding to the automated analysis you are interested in. This should be located at `/dashboards/`.

## New Automated Analysis {#newautomatedanalysis}

This will walk you through the creation of a new automated analysis called "yyyy".

1. Create a new repository on [folkehelseinstituttet](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet) with the name `dashboards_yyyy`.
2. Fork this repository to your Github account
3. Clone the forked repository to `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_xxxx`
4. Download [dashboards_template](https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/dashboards_xxxx) and copy all of its contents into `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy`
5. Edit the following files:
    - `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy/DESCRIPTION` (`Package: xxxx` -> `Package: yyyy`)
    - `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy/tests/testthat.R` (`library(xxxx)`->`library(yyyy)`)
    - `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy/.travis.yml` (`xxxx`->`yyyy`)
    - `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy/inst/bin/0_run.sh` (`xxxx`->`yyyy`)
    - `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy/inst/src/RunProcess.sh` (`xxxx`->`yyyy`)
    - `~/git/dashboards/dashboards_yyyy/inst/src/RunTest.sh` (`xxxx`->`yyyy`)
    
6. Ask Richard to log into travis-ci.com and add the `GITHUB_PAT` environmental variable to activate continuous integration for `yyyy`
7. Submit pull requests and ensure that:
    - Everything works
    - The package is successfully build and included in https://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/drat/tree/gh-pages/src/contrib
8. Add your package under the secton "## DRAT PACKAGES FROM FHI" at https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/Dockerfile
9. Create the 4 folders `data_raw`, `data_clean`, `results`, `data_app` at https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/Dockerfile
10. Add your package's [0_run.sh](#Runsh) to https://github.com/raubreywhite/dashboards_control/blob/master/infrastructure/dashboards_r/crontab
11. Add your package's [test_yyyy.sh](#integrationtesting) to `Jenkins` on `Linux`
12. Hope it works!

## Development guidelines

We try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.

1. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, merge changes from the original repo to your clone by using:
```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```
2. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).
3. Make your changes:
    * Write your code.
    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).
    * Document your code (see function documentation above).
    * Do an `R CMD check` using `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.
    * Commit your changes locally
    * Merge changes from the original repo (again)
    * Do an `R CMD check` using `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).
6. If you are reviewing the pull request, wait until the [travis-ci](www.travis-ci.org) unit tests have finished

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pull_request_before_checks.png")
```

7. Please make sure that the unit tests `PASS` before merging in!!

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pull_request_checks_failed.png")
```

## Code style

- Function names start with capital letters
- Variable names start with small letters
- Environments should be in ALL CAPS
- Reference [Hadley's style code](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
- <- is preferred over = for assignment
- Indentation is with two spaces, not two or a tab. There should be no tabs in code files.
- if () {} else {} constructions should always use full curly braces even when usage seems unnecessary from a clarity perspective.
- TODO statements should be opened as GitHub issues with links to specific code files and code lines, rather than written inline.
- Follow Hadleyâ€™s suggestion for aligning long functions with many arguments:
```
 long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                                b = "another argument",
                                c = "another long argument") {
   # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
 }
```
- Never use print() to send text to the console. Instead use message(), warning(), and error() as appropriate.
- Use environment variables, not options(), to store global arguments that are used by many or all functions.
